# Co-Driver Modding

This page describes how to make a co-driver for the [Pacenote plugin](https://www.rallysimfans.hu/rbr/downloads/other/RBR_Pacenote_Plugin_Quick_Start_Guide.pdf).

The pacenote plugin comes with quite detailed information about the out-of-the-box supported pacenotes and other important documentation.
In Rallysimfans, you can find the documentation in `<RSF root folder>\Plugins\Pacenote\doc`.
You should consult this documenation to know which note ID's should be used to be compatible with the offically supported pacenotes.
